# Custom ISA Assembler and Simulator

## Introduction

This project includes an assembler and a simulator for a custom instruction set architecture (ISA). The assembler translates assembly code into machine code, and the simulator executes the machine code instructions, mimicking the behavior of a CPU.

## Features

### Assembler
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Logical Operations:** XOR, OR, AND, NOT.
- **Data Movement:** Load, Store, Move.
- **Shift Operations:** Right Shift, Left Shift.
- **Comparison:** Compare.
- **Control Flow:** Jump, Jump if Less Than, Jump if Greater Than, Jump if Equal, Halt.
- **Label Support:** Labels for marking addresses and jump targets.
- **Immediate and Register Operands:** Support for both types of operands.

### Simulator
- **Instruction Execution:** Execute machine code instructions generated by the assembler.
- **Register Management:** Maintain and update register values.
- **Memory Management:** Load and store values from/to memory.
- **Control Flow Handling:** Support for jumps and conditional jumps.
- **Halt Detection:** Recognize and stop execution on halt instruction.

## Instruction Set

The custom ISA supports the following instructions:

| Mnemonic | Opcode  | Description                             |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `add`    | 00000   | Add contents of two registers           |
| `sub`    | 00001   | Subtract contents of two registers      |
| `movB`   | 00010   | Move immediate value to register        |
| `mov`    | 00011   | Move value from one register to another |
| `ld`     | 00100   | Load value from memory to register      |
| `st`     | 00101   | Store value from register to memory     |
| `mul`    | 00110   | Multiply contents of two registers      |
| `div`    | 00111   | Divide contents of two registers        |
| `rs`     | 01000   | Right shift register by immediate value |
| `ls`     | 01001   | Left shift register by immediate value  |
| `xor`    | 01010   | XOR contents of two registers           |
| `or`     | 01011   | OR contents of two registers            |
| `and`    | 01100   | AND contents of two registers           |
| `not`    | 01101   | NOT operation on a register             |
| `cmp`    | 01110   | Compare two registers                   |
| `jmp`    | 01111   | Unconditional jump                      |
| `jlt`    | 10000   | Jump if less than                       |
| `jgt`    | 10001   | Jump if greater than                    |
| `je`     | 10010   | Jump if equal                           |
| `hlt`    | 10011   | Halt the program                        |

## Usage

### Assembler

#### Input Format

The assembler expects assembly instructions to be provided via standard input. Each instruction should be on a separate line. Labels can be used to mark jump targets.

#### Example

```assembly
start:  mov r1, 5
        add r1, r2
        jmp start
        hlt
